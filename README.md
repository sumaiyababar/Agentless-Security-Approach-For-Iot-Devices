# Agentless-Security-Approach-For-Iot-Devices
This project is mainly consisting of two parts Networking and Machine Learning.
IoT Networking:
For the networking we have considered the scenario of ICU room consisting of two beds and various sensors dividing into the category of
(1) Pateint Monitoring 
(2) Environment Monitoring
To build the simulation of Use Case and genertion of traffic, IoT Flock is used.

Kindly use this referral link for generating the network traffic
Use the wireshark to capture the pcap files and use the pcap2CSV.py to obtain the csv files 
Machine Learning
The traing and testing is done in the attached colaboratory notebook
Then the serialization is done for the deployoment purposes.
